# Loan Prediction Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. By analyzing customer data, the model aims to assist financial institutions in making informed loan approval decisions, thereby minimizing financial risk.

## Solution Approach

1. **Data Exploration**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify key patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
3. **Model Selection**: Trained multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best-performing model.
5. **Final Testing**: Tested the selected model on unseen data to validate its performance and generate insights for loan approval.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python 3.12 installed along with the following libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced data visualizations.
- **jupyter**: For running and sharing the notebooks.
